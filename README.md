# Inconsistent Widths with `box-sizing: border-box;`

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle issue that can arise when using `box-sizing: border-box;` in CSS.  The `box-sizing` property, while incredibly useful for simplifying layout calculations, can sometimes produce unexpected results, particularly within nested elements or complex layouts.

The problem lies in how the browser calculates the total width of an element when `box-sizing: border-box;` is applied.  While it is intended to include padding and border within the element's total width, the interaction between percentage-based widths, dynamic content, and nested elements can lead to inconsistencies between the calculated width and the visual representation.

This repository provides example CSS code demonstrating the issue, along with a solution to mitigate the unexpected behavior.
